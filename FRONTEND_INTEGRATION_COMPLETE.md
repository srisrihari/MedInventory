Open browser developer tools (F12) and check the Console:
```
✅ Should see: "API Request: GET /api/inventory/items"
✅ Should see: "API Success: GET /api/inventory/items"
❌ If errors: Check backend is running on port 8000
```

- No "Loading..." spinners stuck
- Real medical items visible (not "Item 1", "Item 2")

### **Add/Subtract Stock Test** 
1. Note current quantity of any item (e.g., Paracetamol: 934)
2. Add 100 units
3. Page should instantly show new quantity (1034)
4. Check backend logs - should see API calls

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **"Can't connect to backend"**
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

### **"Items not loading"**
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify backend URL in `src/lib/api.ts` 
- Make sure both servers are running

### **"Add/Subtract not working"**
- Check browser console for 500 errors
- Verify backend mock database is working
- Try refreshing the inventory page

### **"TypeScript errors"**
```bash
# Install missing dependencies  
npm install axios @tanstack/react-query
```
